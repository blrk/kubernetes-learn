    * cluster-admin - allows read/write access to resources from all namespaces
    * admin - allows read/write access to resources in a particular namespace (includes role and rolesbinding)
    * edit - allows read/write access to resources in a specific namespace excpet roles and rolebinding (have access to secrects)
    * view - allows ready only access to resources in a namepsce except roles, rolebinding and secrects

#### Creating roles

```bash
k create role readonly-role --verb=list,get,watch --resource=pods,deployments,services
```
